Simple, light weight plugin to add the "theme-color" meta tag to your website. Compatible with (Android, iOS and Windows Phone).

== Description ==

Starting in version 39 of Chrome for Android on Lollipop, you’ll now be able to use the theme-color meta tag to set the toolbar color. This means no more Seattle gray toolbars! The syntax is pretty simple: the plugin will add a meta tag to your page’s <head> with the name="theme-color", and set the content to any valid CSS color using our color picker!

For example, to set the background to your favourite color or HTML5Rocks orange:

<meta name="theme-color" content="#db5945">
